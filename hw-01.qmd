    **Your Self-Introduction:**
  
  My name is Michael Gephart. I am a *computer science* and *mathematics* major at **Marquette University**. I am a trombone player in the Marquette Pep Band. I enjoy going to ***basketball*** games and traveling to postseason tournaments `:airplane:`. This semester I've been working on computer science side projects to put on my resume. I've built games using Pygame and my own personal [website](https://mrgephart.com/). I hope to find a full time computer or data science job soon after I graduate this spring. One reason why I study computer science is to learn how to problem solve. I like using my problem solving abilities to help others. I also study computer science because it is very challenging. Something that helps me overcome challenges is remembering one of my favorite quotes

> "Adversity is an opportunity"

It reminds me that overcoming challenges is how we grow and become better versions of ourselves.
  
  I am from St. Charles, IL. I enjoy **golfing**, *watching sports*, playing video games, and traveling with friends and family. Some countries I've been to include:
  
  1. Canada
  
  2. Mexico
  
  3. Honduras
  
  4. Belize
  
  5. Costa Rica
  
  6. Barbados

I enjoy traveling and being around those close to me. There isn't a particular destination that I like more than another when it comes to traveling. I love traveling to ***mountains***, ***deserts***, ***beaches***, and everything in between. I also love exploring different cultures. I believe that understanding other people's perspectives and taking in their experiences helps people live a richer and more healthy life. 





## Chunk Options

Please check the references <https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html> or <https://yihui.org/knitr/options/> and answer the following questions.

(@)  Please add your nice picture using `knitr::include_graphics()`. Please use
    i) `echo` to not to show the code
    
    ii) `fig-cap` to add a figure caption
    
    iii) `fig-cap-location` to put the caption on the margin.

```{r}
#| label: photo
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "This is my Marquette ID picture"
#| fig-cap-location: margin

knitr::include_graphics("./hw-01_files/my_pic/michael_pic.jpg")

```

(@)  Use the chunk option 
    i) `echo` to **NOT** to show `library(tidyverse)`, `library(ggplot2)`, and `library(ggrepel)`. *Note: you may need to use !expr. Check <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72217651/quarto-rmarkdown-code-block-to-only-display-certain-lines> and <https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html#chunk-options>*
    
    ii) `fig-align` to have the figure right-aligned. 

    ```{r, echo = c(3, 5)}
    #| label: opt-echo
    #| fig-align: right
    
    library(tidyverse)
    library(ggplot2)
    class_avg <- mpg |> 
        group_by(class) |> 
        summarise(displ = median(displ), hwy = median(hwy))
    library(ggrepel)
    ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
        geom_label_repel(aes(label = class), data = class_avg, size = 6, 
                         label.size = 0, segment.color = NA) + 
        geom_point() + theme(legend.position = "none")
    ```


(@)  A Marquette student has a really bad code style. Please 
    i) Add the chunk option `tidy` in the chunk labelled `style` to make her code below more readable. 
    
    ii) Add another option `eval` so that the code is **NOT** run.

```{r}
#| label: style 
#| eval: false
#| tidy: true
library(formatR)


for(k in 1:10){j=cos(sin(k)*k^2)+3;l=exp(k-7*log(k,base=2));print(j*l-5)}
```

(@)  Use the chunk option `results` in the chunk labelled `cat`, so that the text output is "I love **Marquette** and *Data Science*!".

```{r}
#| label: cat
#| results: asis

cat("I love **Marquette** and *Data Science*!\n")
```

(@)  We can re-use a code chunk by using its name! Please create a code chunk and use the option `#| label: photo` to run the code in the code chunk named `photo`. Note that the chunk options are not carried.

```{r}
#| label: photo
```

## Basic R

### Vector

Use the built-in data set `LakeHuron`.

(@)  Find the number of data values in `LakeHuron`.

```{r}
#| label: vec-1
#| eval: true

(v <- length(LakeHuron))

```

(@)  What is the highest and lowest level (in feet) of LakeHuron during the 1875-1972 period?

```{r}
#| label: vec-2
#| eval: true

(high <- max(LakeHuron))
(low <- min(LakeHuron))

```

(@)  Return a logical vector that shows whether the lake level is higher than the average level or not.

```{r}
#| label: vec-3
#| eval: true

lake <- LakeHuron
average <- mean(lake)
result <- lake > average
result

```

(@)  Return years that have higher level than the average.

```{r}
#| label: vec-4
#| eval: true
lake <- LakeHuron
average <- mean(lake)
years <- which(lake > average)
years = years + 1874
years

```

### Data Frame

(@)  Make the `mtcars` dataset as a tibble using `as_tibble()`. Call it `tbl`.

```{r}
#| label: df-2
#| eval: true
tbl <- as_tibble(mtcars)
tbl

```

(@)  Print the sub data of `tbl` that contains the 11th to 15th rows and the last three columns.

```{r}
#| label: df-3
#| eval: true

tbl[11:15,9:11]


```

(@)  Grab the second and the third columns of `tbl` using *list* method and their *name*. (Do **NOT** use matrix method, and their index)

```{r}
#| label: df-4
#| eval: true

tbl[c("cyl", "disp")]

```

(@)  Extract the fourth column of `tbl` as a numerical vector.

```{r}
#| label: df-5
#| eval: true

tbl[[4]]


```

(@)  Start with `tbl`, use the pipe operator `|>` to do the followings sequentially.

    i.  extract the first 10 observations (rows)
    
    ii. find the column names
    
    iii. sort the columns names using `sort()` in a *decreasing* order. (alphabetically from z to a)

```{r}
#| label: df-6
#| eval: true

tbl |> slice(1:10) |> names() |> sort(decreasing = TRUE)


```

### Data Importing

(@)  Read the data `sales.xlsx` from the data folder. Use arguments `sheet`, `skip` and `col_names` so that the output looks like

        # A tibble: 9 x 2
          id      n    
          <chr>   <chr>
        1 Brand 1 n    
        2 1234    8    
        3 8721    2    
        4 1822    3    
        5 Brand 2 n    
        6 3333    1    
        # â€¦ with 3 more rows

```{r}
#| label: import-1
#| eval: true

data <- read_xlsx("./data/sales.xlsx", sheet = 1, skip = 2, col_names = c("id", "n"))
data
```

(@)  Read in the `favourite-food.xlsx` file from the data folder and call the data `fav_food`. Use the argument `na` to treat "N/A" and "99999" as a missing value. Print the data out.

```{r}
#| label: import-2
#| eval: true

fav_food <- read_xlsx("./data/favourite-food.xlsx", na = c("N/A", "99999"))
print(fav_food)


```

## Basic Python

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

### Data Frame

(@)  Import the data set `mtcars.csv` using `pd.read_csv()`. Then print the first five rows.

```{python}
#| label: py-1
#| eval: true

data = pd.read_csv("./data/mtcars.csv")
data.head()


```

(@)  Use method `.iloc` to obtain the first and fourth rows, and the second and third columns. Name the data `dfcar`.

```{python}
#| label: py-2
#| eval: true

dfcar = data.iloc[[0, 3], [1,2]]
print(dfcar)

```

(@)  Set the row names of `dfcar` to `Mazda` and `Hornet`.

```{python}
#| label: py-3
#| eval: true

dfcar.index = ["Mazda", "Hornet"]
print(dfcar)


```

(@)  Use method `.loc` to obtain row `Hornet` and column `disp`.

```{python}
#| label: py-4
#| eval: true

dfcar.loc["Hornet"].at["disp"]

```
